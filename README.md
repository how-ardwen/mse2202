# MSE 2202 Final Project

## Code Implementation Steps

- [x] Initial Upload
  - Create GitHub, invite everyone as collaborators
  - Start Arduino code and establish enough to get the robot moving forwards

- [X] Ultrasonic Sensor Testing and Implementation
  - Test and record ultrasonic sensor behaviour
  - Physically add sensors to robot
  - Implement code to get robot to stop once sensors detect something _x_ distance away

- [ ] IR Testing and implementation
  - Test IR sensitivity and direction
  - Implement code to search for IR signal by spinning, before going towards it

- [ ] Finalize Navigation System
  - Get robot sweeping an area without colliding into anything and then returning to IR beacon once finished
  - Get containment raising arm spinning

- [x] Pigmentation Sensor Testing and Implementation
  - Test and record pigmentation behavior
  - Get LED to shine whatever color the pigment sensor detects 

- [ ] Finalize Sorting System
  - Implement code to get sensors to trigger servo motor. During testing phase, if green, servo turns left, if not green, servo turns right
  - Finish implementing code into robot, refine servo motor timing as well
  - Implement code for final deposit into collection container
